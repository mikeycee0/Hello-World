# Hello-World
My introduction to Github.

Hi, ny name is mikeycee0.
I have completed three online courses designed 
to teach me how to program in Python.
I am 44 years old. I remember trying to create
games on my Apple IIc. That was a very long time
ago. Over 30 years ago. I am looking forward to
creating some games in Python.
